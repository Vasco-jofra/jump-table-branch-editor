      "longdescription": "This plugin allows you to easily edit the branches of an indirect jump. This is helpful in situations where binja fails to identify jump tables. To fix this, previously you would have to use the python console, but with this plugin you can do it from a simple UI.\n\nYou can insert the target addresses as a single addr (hex or decimal) (e.g. `0x2000` or `123`) or a comma separated list (e.g. `0x1d80, 0x1dc0, 0x1de0, 0x1df0, 0x1e00`).",
